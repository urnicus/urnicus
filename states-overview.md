# State Voter Data Access Overview

My comprehensive notes for obtaining voter registration lists and voter history data across all 50 U.S. states.

The costs quoted below are for statewide lists. Local jurisdictions are typically much less expensive. If you have questions about your local jurisdiction, contact your local election office or Secratary of State's office.  I have always had a pleasant and helpful interaction.
