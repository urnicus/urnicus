**Voter List Access**

[Voter Extract Request](https://dos.fl.gov/elections/data-statistics/voter-registration-statistics/voter-extract-request/)

Florida releases their updated voter list monthly on a predetermined day. An email can be sent requesting to be added to the next release date. They will send a CD with the voter list at some point not long after that release date.

My email was responded to in 12 days. Still waiting for my first CD to arrive.

**Voter History**

**Cost**
