# Michigan

**Untested | Access: Open Records | Expense: $**

**Voter List Access**

[Michigan FOIA Form (PDF)](https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/sos/02lehman/FOIA_FORM.pdf?rev=b1ac9e66e4fd4d97ace0e4d9194ceb64)

Submit an open records request and receive via flash drive or ftp

**Voter History**

Yes - option to select voting history on the form

**Cost**

Expected to be low because FOIA guidelines apply. I found estimates of $23-$50, but need to verify.
