**Voter List Access**

[Voter Extract Request](https://dos.fl.gov/elections/data-statistics/voter-registration-statistics/voter-extract-request/)

Florida releases their updated voter list monthly on a predetermined day. An email can be sent requesting to be added to the next release date. They will send a CD with the voter list at some point not long after that release date.

My email was responded to in 12 days. Still waiting for my first CD to arrive.

My understanding is it is included, but I have not verified yet
