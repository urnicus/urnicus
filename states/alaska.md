**Voter List Access**

[Division of Elections](https://www.elections.alaska.gov/research/#akcl)

[Election Office Contacts](https://www.elections.alaska.gov/contact-information/)

"To purchase a list, or for other requests, contact any divisional office for assistance." It appears you either are able to contact the statewide election office or you will need to contact each regional election office for data.

**Voter History**

It appears to be included with the voter list, but I have not verified.

**Cost**

$20 per ballotpedia, but I have not verified.
