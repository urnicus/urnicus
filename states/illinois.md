**Voter List Access**

[Computerized Voter Data](https://www.elections.il.gov/VotingAndRegistrationSystems/ComputerizedVoterData.aspx)

"Voter data is available to registered political committees for bona fide political purposes". Definition of political committee (basically accepts or spends greater than $5000)

[Legislation Doc](https://www.ilga.gov/Documents/legislation/ilcs/documents/001000050K9-1.8.htm) There appears to be a version that can be requested by the public, but redacts street numbers of home addresses which limits usefulness.

**Voter History**

The file can be provided in two formats: One with the last fifteen elections as columns. The second as multiple CSV's requiring the user to join the voter list with the voter history list.

**Cost**

$500
