New Hampshire provides voter history covering **2 years** of election participation.

### Historical Coverage

The 2-year voter history period includes recent election cycles, providing data on voter participation in recent elections.

For specific details about:
- Which elections are included

- Status: Not independently verified
- Contact SOS for official pricing

### Local Data Costs

Before the October 2024 law change, towns could charge fees for voter checklists. The new law now provides:
- **One free copy** for down-ballot candidates
- Additional copies or requests by others may still incur fees
- Costs vary by municipality

## Restrictions and Permitted Uses

When requesting New Hampshire voter data, users must comply with state laws regarding the use of voter registration records.

The new law specifically addresses candidate access, but general provisions for data use likely apply to all requestors.

## Technical Notes

### Decentralized System

New Hampshire's voter data access is more decentralized than most states:
- Statewide data: Contact Secretary of State
- Local data: Contact town clerks
- Different processes and fees by municipality
- Recent law changes affect pricing

### Free Candidate Access

The October 1, 2024 law change represents a significant shift:
- Reduces costs for local candidates
- Levels the playing field in smaller district races
- Applies only to down-ballot (non-statewide) candidates
- Limited to one free copy

### 2-Year History

New Hampshire's 2-year voter history is relatively limited compared to states offering 5, 10, or 15 years of history.

This coverage includes:
- Most recent general election
- Most recent primary election
- Possibly other elections within 2-year window

### Testing Status

This system has not been independently tested. Recommended approach:

**For Statewide Data:**
- Contact NH Secretary of State
- Verify current pricing ($8,300 estimate needs confirmation)
- Understand process and timeline
- Confirm voter history details

**For Local Data:**
- Contact relevant town clerk
- Ask about the Oct. 1, 2024 law change if you're a candidate
- Verify eligibility for free checklist
- Understand delivery options
