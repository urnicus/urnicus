## Voter List

Louisiana provides voter registration data through an online portal system that requires account creation.

### How to Access

1. Visit the [Louisiana Purchase Voter Lists page](https://www.sos.la.gov/electionsandvoting/becomeacandidate/purchasevoterlists/pages/default.aspx)
2. Create an account using the [Louisiana SOS Sign On system](https://sso.sos.la.gov/CreateAccount/SignOn.aspx?AppCode=CMRQ&ReturnUrl=)
3. Log in to your account
4. Select the voter data you need (statewide or specific jurisdictions)
5. Add voter history if desired (additional option during checkout)
6. Complete payment
7. Download your data through the portal

### What's Included

The voter registration file includes information for registered voters in Louisiana.

## Voter History

Louisiana offers voter history as an additional selectable option during the checkout process.

### How to Access

When purchasing voter registration data through the online portal, you can add voter history as an additional option before completing your purchase.

### Historical Coverage

Contact the Secretary of State or review the portal for details about the historical coverage period included in the voter history file.

## Cost

Louisiana uses a per-voter pricing model with a minimum charge and maximum cap:

| Pricing Element | Cost |
|----------------|------|
| **Per Voter Record** | $0.01 (1 cent) |
| **Minimum Purchase** | $20.00 |
| **Maximum Purchase (Statewide)** | $5,000.00 |

This pricing structure means:
- Small jurisdictions: Pay per voter with $20 minimum
- **Statewide list: Capped at $5,000** regardless of total voters

The cap makes Louisiana's statewide voter list relatively affordable despite the per-voter pricing model.

## Restrictions and Permitted Uses

When purchasing Louisiana voter data, users must comply with state laws regarding the use of voter registration records. The online portal will include specific terms of use and legal requirements during the account creation and purchase process.
