2. Download the [Voter Product Order Form PDF](https://sos.wyo.gov/Forms/Elections/General/VoterProductOrderForm.pdf)

### What's Included

The voter registration list includes specified data fields for registered voters in Wyoming. Review the order form for the complete list of fields included in the export.

## Voter History

Voter history is **not explicitly detailed** in the fields included in the export according to the order form.

### Recommendation

When submitting your order form, specifically inquire about:
- Whether voter history data is available
- Whether it can be purchased separately or with the voter list
- What historical coverage would be provided
- Any additional cost for voter history

Contact the Secretary of State's office before submitting your order if voter history is essential for your needs.

## Cost

Wyoming charges **$125** for voter registration data for qualified purchasers.

## Restrictions and Permitted Uses

Wyoming restricts voter data sales to specific categories of purchasers as defined in state statute W.S. 22-2-113(a). This ensures data is used for appropriate political, electoral, and civic engagement purposes.

When requesting Wyoming voter data, qualified purchasers must comply with state laws regarding the use of voter registration records.

## Technical Notes

### Eligibility Verification

Wyoming may verify that requestors meet the eligibility requirements before processing orders. Be prepared to provide documentation of your:
- Candidate status
- Committee registration
- PAC registration
- Elected official status
- Involvement in ballot issue campaigns
- Organizational mission to promote voter participation

### Field Limitations

The order form explicitly details which fields are included in the voter registration export. Review the form carefully to ensure the available fields meet your data needs.

### No Explicit Voter History

Unlike many states, Wyoming's order form does not list voter history participation as one of the included fields. This may mean:
- Voter history is not available
- Voter history is available separately
- Voter history must be specifically requested

Clarify this with the Secretary of State before ordering.

### Testing Status

This system has not been independently tested. Contact the Wyoming Secretary of State for current information about:
- Eligibility documentation requirements

Wyoming provides affordable access to voter registration data at $125, but restricts purchases to qualified entities involved in political and electoral activities. The unclear status of voter history availability requires direct inquiry with the Secretary of State to confirm what historical data, if any, is available.
