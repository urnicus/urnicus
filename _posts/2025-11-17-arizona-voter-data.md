2. Submit a public records request for voter registration data
3. Specify statewide or specific county/jurisdiction data
4. Include details about format and delivery preferences
5. Work with the Secretary of State's office on fulfillment
6. Pay applicable fees

### What's Included

The voter registration data should include information for registered voters in Arizona, subject to public records law provisions.

## Voter History

The availability of voter history through Arizona's public records request process is unclear.

### Recommendation

When submitting your public records request, specifically ask about:
- Whether voter history is available
- Whether it's included with voter registration data
- What historical coverage is provided
- Any additional fees for voter history
- File format and structure

## Cost

Based on available sources, Arizona voter data costs approximately **$516** for statewide access. However, this estimate has not been independently verified.

### Public Records Fees

As a public records request, Arizona may charge fees based on:
- Staff time to compile the data
- Media costs (CDs, flash drives, etc.)
- Delivery costs
- Other allowable fees under Arizona public records law

Contact the Secretary of State's office for an official cost estimate before submitting your request.

## Restrictions and Permitted Uses

When requesting Arizona voter data, users must comply with state laws regarding the use of public records and voter registration information.

## Technical Notes

### Public Records Request System

Unlike many states with dedicated voter list purchase programs, Arizona appears to rely on its public records request infrastructure for voter data access.

**Characteristics:**
- Request-based rather than self-service
- Pricing may vary based on specific request
- Processing time depends on request complexity
- Format and delivery negotiated with requestor

### NextRequest Portal

Arizona uses the NextRequest system for managing public records requests, which provides:
- Online request submission
- Request tracking
- Communication with records staff
- Status updates

### Cost Uncertainty

The $516 estimate comes from secondary sources (Ballotpedia) and should be confirmed:
1. Submit a public records request
2. Ask for a cost estimate before proceeding
3. Confirm what's included in the estimate
4. Verify delivery method and format

### Testing Status

This system has not been independently tested. Recommended approach:
1. Use the NextRequest portal to submit an inquiry
2. Ask specifically about:
   - Statewide voter registration data availability
   - Current costs and fee structure
   - Voter history availability
   - File formats provided
   - Delivery methods
   - Estimated processing time
3. Get a formal cost estimate before committing

## Alternative: Contact Direct

If the NextRequest portal process is unclear, consider contacting the Arizona Secretary of State's Elections Division directly to ask about voter registration data access.

Arizona's voter data access through public records requests provides a path to obtaining voter registration information, though the process may be less standardized than dedicated voter list programs in other states. The estimated $516 cost should be confirmed through the official request process, and voter history availability should be clarified when submitting your request.
