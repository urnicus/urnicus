South Carolina's voter data system provides comprehensive information with 4 elections of voter history and optional mailing labels at a capped price of $2,500 for statewide data. However, the requirement to be a registered South Carolina voter significantly limits who can access this data, making it unavailable to out-of-state researchers, media, and campaigns unless they work with SC-registered individuals.
