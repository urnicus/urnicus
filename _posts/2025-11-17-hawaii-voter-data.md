Hawaii's voter registration data is managed at the county level rather than through a centralized state system. Requestors must contact each of the four county election divisions separately to obtain voter data, with each county setting its own fees and processes.

## Quick Summary

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Statewide Cost** | Varies by county (~$100+ estimated) |
| **Voter List Access** | Contact each county separately |
| **Voter History Access** | Appears to be available (verification recommended) |
| **Delivery Method** | CD mailed (confirmed for Maui, likely others) |
| **Processing Time** | Varies by county |
| **Counties** | 4 counties (Honolulu, Maui, Hawaii, Kauai) |

## County-Based System

Unlike most states, Hawaii does not provide a statewide voter file through a single state office. Instead, you must contact each of the four county election divisions independently.

### The Four County Election Divisions

1. **City and County of Honolulu**
   - [Honolulu Elections Division](https://www.honolulu.gov/elections/reports-certificates/)

2. **County of Maui**
   - [Maui County Clerk - Elections Division](https://www.mauicounty.gov/DocumentCenter/View/136272/Affidavit-on-Application-for-Voter-Registration-Data-2021)

3. **County of Hawaii**
   - Contact information available via the [Hawaii Office of Elections](https://elections.hawaii.gov/resources/county-election-divisions/)

4. **County of Kauai**
   - Contact information available via the [Hawaii Office of Elections](https://elections.hawaii.gov/resources/county-election-divisions/)

## Voter List

Each county maintains its own voter registration data and has its own request process.

### How to Access

1. Visit the [Hawaii County Election Divisions page](https://elections.hawaii.gov/resources/county-election-divisions/)
2. Contact each county's election division separately
3. Request the voter registration application form for each county
4. Complete each county's specific form (forms may vary)
5. Submit payment according to each county's fee schedule
6. Receive CD via mail (confirmed for Maui, appears true for Honolulu)

### Example: Maui County

- Application form: [Affidavit on Application for Voter Registration Data](https://www.mauicounty.gov/DocumentCenter/View/136272/Affidavit-on-Application-for-Voter-Registration-Data-2021)
- Cost: $100 + $7.35 postage
- Delivery: CD mailed after ordering

## Voter History

Initial research indicates voter history is available with voter registration data, but this should be confirmed with each county.

### Recommendation

When contacting each county election division, specifically verify:
- Whether voter history is included
- What historical coverage is provided
- File format and delivery method
- Current fees

## Cost

Costs vary by county:

| County | Cost | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| **Maui** | $100 + $7.35 postage | Confirmed |
| **Honolulu** | Not yet verified | Research needed |
| **Hawaii** | Not yet verified | Research needed |
| **Kauai** | Not yet verified | Research needed |

To obtain a complete statewide file, you must purchase data from all four counties separately.

## Restrictions and Permitted Uses

Each county may have its own terms of use. When requesting voter data, users must comply with Hawaii state laws and individual county requirements regarding the use of voter registration records.

## Technical Notes

### Decentralized System

Hawaii's county-based system means:
- Four separate requests required for statewide data
- Potentially four different forms
- Potentially four different fee structures
- Potentially four different file formats
- Multiple delivery timelines

### Delivery Format

At least for Maui County (and likely others), data is delivered on CD via mail.

### Testing Status

This system has not been independently tested. Recommended steps:
1. Contact all four county election divisions
2. Confirm current fees for each county
3. Verify voter history availability
4. Clarify file formats and delivery methods

Hawaii's county-based voter data system requires more effort than centralized state systems but provides access to comprehensive voter information. Budget for multiple fees and plan for coordinating with four separate election divisions to obtain complete statewide data.
