## Technical Notes

### Voter History Structure

Kentucky's voter history format is noteworthy:

**Per Year:**
- Primary election participation: Yes/No or similar indicator
- General election participation: Yes/No or similar indicator

**Five Years** = **10 participation data points** (5 primaries + 5 generals)

This granular structure helps identify:
- Regular general election voters
- Primary election participants
- Consistent voters vs. sporadic voters
- Participation patterns across election types

### Odd-Year State Elections

Kentucky's odd-year elections for state offices add complexity:
- State executive elections (Governor, etc.): Odd years
- Federal elections (President, Congress): Even years
- Must understand which years had which elections
- Voter history spans both calendars
