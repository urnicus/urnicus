### Data Access Laws

Source: IC 3-7-26.3; IC 3-7-26.4

## Voter History

The availability of voter history data for non-political-party subscribers is unclear from available documentation.

### For Political Parties

Political party committees with unrestricted access should confirm voter history availability with the Indiana Election Division.

### For Other Requestors

It's unclear whether voter history is available to requestors who receive the restricted voter file. Options may include:
- Voter history unavailable with restricted access
- Voter history available through the subscription
- Voter history available via separate public records request to counties

### Recommendation

Contact the Indiana Election Division to clarify:
- Whether voter history is included with subscription
- What historical coverage is provided
- Whether voter history is available to non-political-party subscribers

## Cost

Indiana charges **$5,000** for an annual subscription to the statewide voter registration file.

This cost applies to both:
- Political party committees (unrestricted file)
- Other requestors (restricted/redacted file)

## Subscription Model

Indiana uses an **annual subscription** system:
- Pay $5,000 per calendar year
- Receive access to voter registration data
- Likely includes updates throughout the year
- Renew annually to maintain access

Contact the Indiana Election Division for details about:
- Update frequency
- How updates are delivered
- Mid-year subscription options
- Renewal process

## Restrictions and Permitted Uses

Indiana's voter registration system laws contain provisions regarding:
- Who may access data
- What information is included based on requestor type
- How data may be used

Review IC 3-7-26.3 and IC 3-7-26.4 for complete legal requirements.

When requesting Indiana voter data, subscribers must comply with state laws regarding the use of voter registration records.

## Alternative: County-Level Public Records Requests

If the $5,000 statewide subscription is not feasible, consider:
- Making public records requests directly to counties
- Requesting voter history at the county level
- Combining data from multiple counties as needed

This approach may provide access to information not available in the restricted statewide file.

## Technical Notes

### Uncertain Clarity for Non-Political Entities

The guidebook language is somewhat unclear about:
- Whether non-political-party requestors can actually obtain the file
- What specific information is redacted for non-party requestors
- Whether voter history is available to non-party subscribers

**Recommendation**: Call the Indiana Election Division before applying to clarify eligibility and what data you'll receive.

### Political Party Definition

Ensure you understand what qualifies as a "state major political party committee" under Indiana law before applying for unrestricted access.

This system has not been independently tested. Contact the Indiana Election Division for current information about:
- Eligibility requirements
- Subscription details
- Processing timelines
- Payment methods
- Delivery methods
