## Voter List

Nevada provides voter registration data through a structured two-step process managed by the Secretary of State's office.

### How to Access

Nevada has outlined a two-step process for obtaining statewide voter registration data:

1. Visit the [Nevada NevVoter Statewide List page](https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/elections/voters/nevvoter-statewide-list)
2. Review the two-step process outlined on the page
3. Follow Step 1 instructions (specific process not detailed in available research)
4. Complete Step 2 requirements
5. Submit payment
6. Receive voter data after processing

**Recommendation**: Contact the Nevada Secretary of State's office directly for detailed instructions on both steps of the process.

## Voter History

Based on the "NevVoter Statewide List" terminology, voter history appears to be included with the statewide voter registration data.

### Recommendation

When contacting the Secretary of State about the two-step process, specifically verify:
- Whether voter history is included in the NevVoter statewide list
- What historical coverage is provided
- File format and structure
- How to match voter history to registration data

## Cost

Nevada's voter data cost is potentially one of the highest in the United States at an estimated **$20,000** for statewide access.

### Pricing Basis

Nevada Revised Statutes (NRS 293.440) authorizes the Secretary of State to charge **1 cent per voter name** for voter registration lists.

**Calculation:**
- Nevada registered voters: ~2,000,000 (approximate)
- Price per voter: $0.01
- **Estimated statewide cost**: ~$20,000

> **Note**: This estimate is based on the statutory fee of "1 cent per name" mentioned in NRS 293.440. The actual cost should be confirmed with the Nevada Secretary of State.

### Cost Verification

The $20,000 estimate comes from:
1. Nevada state law authorizing $0.01 per name (NRS 293.440)
2. Estimated voter population
3. Secondary source confirmation (no official source cited in research)

**Before proceeding**, contact the Secretary of State to:
- Confirm current pricing
- Verify per-voter fee
- Ask about any fee caps or alternative pricing
- Understand total cost for statewide data

## Restrictions and Permitted Uses

When requesting Nevada voter data, users must comply with Nevada Revised Statutes and other state laws regarding the use of voter registration records.

Review NRS 293.440 and related statutes for specific legal requirements and permitted uses.

## Technical Notes

### Two-Step Process

Nevada's two-step process suggests a more involved procedure than many states:
- May include application/approval stage
- Likely includes verification of requestor
- Could involve legal agreements or attestations
- Requires direct engagement with Secretary of State

### High Cost Barrier

At an estimated $20,000, Nevada's voter data is among the most expensive in the nation:
- Only affordable for well-funded campaigns
- Prohibitive for researchers, journalists, and civic organizations
- May limit transparency and public access
- Consider county-level alternatives if available

### Per-Voter Pricing Impact

The per-voter pricing model means:
- Costs scale with voter population
- No cap on maximum fees (unless otherwise specified)
- County or municipal data may be more affordable
- Targeted geographic analysis may be more cost-effective

### Official Confirmation Needed

**Critical**: The $20,000 estimate and many details about Nevada's process have not been independently verified. Before making any commitments:

1. Contact Nevada Secretary of State directly
2. Request official pricing information
3. Ask for detailed process documentation
4. Verify voter history inclusion
5. Understand file formats and delivery
6. Confirm legal requirements and uses

### Testing Status

This system has not been independently tested. The two-step process requires clarification from the Secretary of State to understand:
- Exact steps required
- Timeline for each step
- Required documentation
- Payment procedures
- Data delivery method
- Actual costs
