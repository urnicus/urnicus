New Jersey provides access to voter registration data through public records requests (OPRA - Open Public Records Act). While not available through a standardized purchase program, voter data can be obtained for an estimated $375 through the open records process.

## Quick Summary

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Estimated Cost** | ~$375 (not independently verified) |
| **Voter List Access** | Open Public Records Act (OPRA) request |
| **Voter History Access** | Status unclear - inquire with request |
| **Delivery Method** | Based on OPRA request fulfillment |
| **Processing Time** | Subject to OPRA timelines |

## Voter List

New Jersey appears to provide voter registration data through the Open Public Records Act (OPRA) rather than a dedicated voter list purchase program.

### How to Access

1. Prepare an OPRA (Open Public Records Act) request
2. Submit the request to the appropriate New Jersey government office (likely Secretary of State or Division of Elections)
3. Specify that you're requesting voter registration data
4. Include details about statewide vs. county/municipal data
5. Specify format preferences (digital, physical media, etc.)
6. Pay applicable OPRA fees when invoiced
7. Receive voter data according to OPRA fulfillment procedures

### What's Included

The voter registration data should include information for registered voters in New Jersey, subject to public records law provisions and any privacy protections.

## Voter History

The availability of voter history through New Jersey's OPRA process is unclear from available research.

### Recommendation

When submitting your OPRA request, specifically inquire about:
- Whether voter history is available as a public record
- What historical coverage period is provided
- Whether voter history requires a separate request
- Any additional fees for voter history data
- File format and structure for matching to voter registration

## Cost

Based on secondary sources, New Jersey voter data through OPRA requests costs approximately **$375**.

However, this estimate should be confirmed, as OPRA fees may vary based on:
- Specific records requested
- Volume of data
- Format requested
- Staff time required
- Media costs
- Other allowable fees under OPRA

### OPRA Fee Structure

Under New Jersey's Open Public Records Act, government agencies may charge fees for:
- Special service charges (staff time beyond basic search)
- Actual cost of copying/duplication
- Media costs (CDs, flash drives, etc.)
- Delivery costs

Contact the appropriate office for an official cost estimate before proceeding.

## Restrictions and Permitted Uses

New Jersey voter data obtained through OPRA requests is subject to:
- Open Public Records Act provisions
- Privacy protections under state law
- Any applicable restrictions on voter registration data use

When requesting New Jersey voter data, users must comply with state laws regarding the use of public records and voter registration information.

## Technical Notes

### OPRA-Based Access

Unlike states with dedicated voter data sales programs, New Jersey appears to rely on its public records law framework:

**Characteristics:**
- Request-based process
- Subject to OPRA timelines and procedures
- Fees based on actual costs
- May require negotiation on format and delivery
- Processing time follows public records law

**OPRA Timeline:**
- Immediate access when possible
- Response required within 7 business days if not immediate
- Extended timelines possible for large or complex requests

### No Standardized Portal

New Jersey does not appear to offer:
- Online voter data purchase system
- Standardized pricing
- Self-service downloads
- Automated ordering

This means each request may be handled individually with variable timelines and exact costs.

### Cost Uncertainty

The $375 estimate comes from secondary sources and should be verified:
1. Submit an OPRA request or inquiry
2. Ask for a cost estimate before proceeding
3. Confirm what's included
4. Verify file format and delivery method
5. Understand timeline for fulfillment

### Voter History Availability

Because voter history availability is unclear, your OPRA request should explicitly:
- Ask whether voter history is available
- Request it be included if available
- Inquire about format and matching process
- Confirm any additional costs

### Testing Status

This system has not been independently tested. Recommended approach:

1. **Identify the Correct Office:**
   - Likely NJ Division of Elections
   - Possibly county-level election offices
   - Confirm which office maintains statewide voter data

2. **Submit Initial Inquiry:**
   - Ask about OPRA process for voter data
   - Request cost estimate
   - Confirm voter history availability
   - Understand timeline

3. **Prepare Detailed OPRA Request:**
   - Specific records requested
   - Format preferences
   - Delivery method
   - Timeline needs

New Jersey's voter data access through OPRA requests provides a path to obtaining voter registration information, though the process is less standardized than dedicated purchase programs in other states. The estimated $375 cost should be confirmed through the official request process, and voter history availability should be clarified when submitting your OPRA request. Be prepared for the request-based timeline and procedures required under New Jersey's Open Public Records Act.
