Missouri provides access to voter registration data through public records requests under the state's Sunshine Law. With an estimated cost of approximately $35 for statewide data, Missouri offers very affordable access to voter information, though voter history availability should be confirmed.

## Quick Summary

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Statewide Cost** | ~$35 (estimated, not independently verified) |
| **Voter List Access** | Sunshine Law / Open Records Request |
| **Voter History Access** | Status unclear - verify with request |
| **Delivery Method** | Based on request fulfillment |
| **Processing Time** | Subject to Sunshine Law timelines |

## Voter List

Missouri appears to provide voter registration data through open records requests under Missouri's Sunshine Law rather than a dedicated voter data purchase program.

### How to Access

1. Visit the [Missouri Secretary of State Elections page](https://www.sos.mo.gov/elections)
2. Access the [Sunshine Law Request Portal](https://s1.sos.mo.gov/requests)
3. Submit an open records request for voter registration data
4. Specify statewide or county/jurisdiction-level data
5. Include details about format and delivery preferences
6. Inquire about voter history availability
7. Pay applicable fees based on Sunshine Law provisions
8. Receive voter data according to fulfillment procedures

### What's Included

The voter registration data should include information for registered voters in Missouri, subject to public records law provisions.

## Voter History

The availability of voter history through Missouri's open records request process is not confirmed in available research.

### Recommendation

When submitting your open records request, specifically ask about:
- Whether voter history is available as a public record
- What historical coverage period is provided
- Whether voter history requires a separate request or fee
- File format and how it matches to voter registration data

Since voter history is unclear, make this a priority question in your initial request.

## Cost

Based on secondary sources, Missouri voter data costs approximately **$35** for statewide data through open records requests.

This estimate aligns with typical Sunshine Law fee structures, which limit costs to:
- Actual copying/duplication costs
- Reasonable staff time charges
- Media costs
- Other allowable fees

### Sunshine Law Fee Limits

Under Missouri's Sunshine Law, government agencies may charge:
- Research time (first hour typically free)
- Copying costs at statutory rates
- Actual cost of media (CDs, flash drives, etc.)
- No excessive or profit-based fees

Contact the Secretary of State's office for an official cost estimate before proceeding.

## Restrictions and Permitted Uses

Missouri voter data obtained through Sunshine Law requests is subject to:
- Missouri Sunshine Law provisions
- Privacy protections under state law
- Any applicable restrictions on voter registration data use

When requesting Missouri voter data, users must comply with state laws regarding the use of public records and voter registration information.

## Technical Notes

### Sunshine Law Framework

Missouri's reliance on its Sunshine Law (open records law) for voter data access provides:

**Characteristics:**
- Request-based process
- Statutory fee limits
- Transparency requirements
- Public oversight

**Timeline:**
- Response required "as soon as possible"
- Extended timelines for large/complex requests
- Must provide reason if delayed

### Online Request Portal

Missouri provides an online portal for Sunshine Law requests:
- Web-based submission
- Request tracking
- Communication with records custodian
- Status updates

This streamlines the process compared to mail/email-only systems.

### Cost Uncertainty

The $35 estimate should be verified:
1. Submit a request or inquiry
2. Ask for a cost estimate before proceeding
3. Confirm what's included
4. Verify delivery method and format
5. Understand timeline for fulfillment

At $35, Missouri would be among the most affordable states for voter data, comparable to Arkansas ($2.50) and Michigan ($23-$50).

### Voter History Priority

Since voter history availability is unclear:
- Make it prominent in your request
- Ask specifically about historical coverage
- Inquire about additional costs
- Request sample data structure if available

### No Standardized Program

Missouri does not appear to offer:
- Dedicated voter data sales program
- Standardized pricing
- Self-service downloads
- Automated ordering

Each request is handled under Sunshine Law procedures.

### Testing Status

This system has not been independently tested. Recommended approach:

1. **Use the Online Portal:**
   - Submit initial inquiry through [https://s1.sos.mo.gov/requests](https://s1.sos.mo.gov/requests)
   - Ask about voter registration data availability
   - Request cost estimate
   - Inquire about voter history

2. **Include in Request:**
   - Statewide voter registration data
   - Voter history (if available)
   - Preferred format (CSV, database, etc.)
   - Delivery method preferences
   - Timeline needs

3. **Verify Before Proceeding:**
   - Actual cost
   - What's included
   - Processing timeline
   - File formats
