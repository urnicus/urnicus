### What's Included

The voter registration file includes information for all registered voters in Iowa.

## Voter History

Iowa offers voter history as a selectable option on the voter list request form.

### How to Access

When completing the Voter List Request Form, check the box to include voter history with your subscription.

### Historical Coverage

Contact the Secretary of State for details about the historical coverage period included in the voter history file.

## Cost

Iowa charges **$1,500** for an annual subscription to voter registration data.

The annual subscription model means you pay once per year for access to voter data, likely with updates throughout the year.

## Subscription Model

Iowa uses an **annual subscription** approach rather than a one-time purchase. This subscription likely provides:
- Initial voter registration file
- Updates throughout the year
- Ongoing access for 12 months
- Voter history (if selected)

Contact the Secretary of State to confirm:
- How many updates are provided during the subscription period
- Update frequency
- How updates are delivered
- Subscription renewal process

## Restrictions and Permitted Uses

When requesting Iowa voter data, users must comply with state laws regarding the use of voter registration records. The request form will include specific terms of use and legal requirements.

## Technical Notes

### Request Methods

Iowa accepts request forms via:
- **Mail**: Send to address specified on form
- **Email**: Send to email address specified on form

This flexibility allows you to choose the most convenient submission method.

### Checkbox Option

The voter history checkbox on the form makes it simple to include historical voting data with your subscription.

### Annual Model

The annual subscription model is different from most states, which charge for a single snapshot of data. Iowa's approach likely provides better value if you need current data throughout the year.

### Testing Status

This system has not been independently tested. Contact the Iowa Secretary of State for current information about:
- Subscription details and update frequency
- Processing timelines
- Payment methods
- Delivery methods
- File formats
- Voter history coverage
