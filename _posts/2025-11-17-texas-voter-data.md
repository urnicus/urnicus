Texas provides access to voter registration data and voter history through a unique combination of state-level and county-level systems. Some counties offer immediate online downloads, while the statewide list requires a signed and notarized form with a $75 deposit plus additional sliding-scale fees.

## Quick Summary

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Statewide Cost** | $75 deposit + sliding scale (estimated $1,279 total) |

## Voter List

Texas offers multiple pathways to access voter registration data depending on whether you need statewide or county-specific information.

### Statewide Access

For statewide voter data through the Texas Secretary of State:

1. Download the [Public Information Request Form PDF](https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/forms/pi.pdf)
2. Complete the form
3. Check the voter history box if desired
4. **Get the form signed and notarized** (required)
5. Submit the form with $75 deposit
6. Pay additional fees based on sliding scale
7. Receive voter data after processing

**Estimated Total Cost**: Approximately $1,279 according to Ballotpedia

### County-Level Access (Immediate Download)

Some Texas counties offer immediate online access to voter data:

**Travis County**
- Website: [Travis County Tax Office Voter Data](https://tax-office.traviscountytx.gov/pages/voterdata.php)
- Immediate download available

**Collin County**
- Website: [Collin County Elections Store](https://www.collincountytx.gov/Elections/election-store)
- Immediate download available

Additional counties may offer similar services. Check with your target county's election office or tax assessor-collector.

## Voter History

Texas provides voter history data as a selectable option on the statewide request form.

### How to Access

When completing the Public Information Request Form for statewide data, check the box for voter history to include it with your order.

For county-specific data, check individual county websites for voter history availability.

## Cost

| Access Method | Cost |
|---------------|------|
| **Statewide** | $75 deposit + sliding scale ≈ $1,279 total |
| **Individual Counties** | Varies by county; some may be free or low-cost |

The sliding scale for statewide data is based on the number of records requested.

## Restrictions and Permitted Uses

When requesting Texas voter data, users must comply with state laws regarding the use of voter registration records. The request form will include specific terms of use and legal requirements.

## Technical Notes

### Notarization Requirement

The statewide request form must be **signed and notarized**, making Texas one of the few states requiring notarization for voter data access.

This requirement adds an extra step compared to most states:
- Find a notary public
- Sign the form in the notary's presence
- Pay notary fees (typically $5-15)

### County Variation

Texas's county-based system means:
- Each county may have different processes
- Some counties offer instant online access
- Pricing varies by county
- File formats may differ

### Immediate Download Counties

At least two counties offer immediate download options:
- **Travis County**: Includes the state capital (Austin)
- **Collin County**: Major suburban county north of Dallas

These county-specific options may be faster and cheaper than requesting statewide data, depending on your needs.

### Testing Status

This system has not been independently tested. For statewide access, contact the Texas Secretary of State. For county access, contact individual county election offices or visit their websites.
