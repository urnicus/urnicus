### Multiple Jurisdiction Options

Georgia's system allows granular selection:
- **Statewide**: All 67 counties ($485)
- **County Level**: Individual counties
- **Municipality Level**: Specific cities or towns
- **District Level**: Specific electoral districts

This flexibility lets you purchase only the data you need.

## Voter History

Georgia provides voter history files separately from the voter list through a different download portal.

### How to Access

1. Visit the [Georgia Voter History Files Portal](https://mvp.sos.ga.gov/s/voter-history-files)
2. Browse available voter history files by year
3. Download the files you need
4. Match voter IDs between voter list and voter history files

### Historical Coverage

Voter history files are available by year and can be downloaded at any time.

### Matching Data

Both the voter list and voter history files contain a voter ID field that allows you to:
- Join the datasets
- Match voter registration to voting history
- Analyze participation patterns
- Build comprehensive voter profiles

## Cost

| Level | Cost |
|-------|------|
| **Statewide (67 counties)** | **$485** |
| Individual County | Varies |
| Municipality | Varies |
| District | Varies |

Voter history files appear to be available for **free download** from the voter history portal.

## Processing Timeline

Based on independent testing of Georgia's system:

**Test 1:**
- Purchase date: Unknown
- Email received: 10 days later

**Test 2:**
- Purchase date: Unknown
- Email received: 21 days later

**Expected Timeline:**
- Purchase confirmation: Immediate
- Email with download link: 10-21 days
- Download: Immediate after link received

Plan for a 2-3 week wait between purchase and data access.

## Restrictions and Permitted Uses

When purchasing Georgia voter data, users must comply with state laws regarding the use of voter registration records. The purchase portal will include specific terms of use and legal requirements.

## Technical Notes

### Email Delivery

Georgia sends a download link via email rather than providing immediate access. This means:
- Monitor your email for the download link
- Link may have an expiration date
- Download promptly when link arrives
- Save the data securely

### Separate History Portal

Unlike many states, Georgia provides voter history through a separate, publicly accessible portal rather than including it with the voter list purchase. This creates:

**Advantages:**
- Voter history appears to be free
- Can download history without purchasing voter list
- Can access multiple years of history
- No waiting period for history files

**Considerations:**
- Must join two separate datasets
- Requires data processing skills
- Two separate downloads to manage

### Voter ID Field

The voter ID field in both files is crucial for matching records. Ensure you understand the ID structure and matching process before purchasing.

### Testing Confirmation

This system has been independently tested and confirmed to work:
- Online purchase process functions correctly
- Email with download link arrives (allow 10-21 days)
- Download process works as expected

### Processing Variability

The 10-21 day processing time range suggests:
- Manual processing or approval steps
- Variable workload at Secretary of State's office
- Possible rush periods around elections

Plan your data needs accordingly and order well in advance of any deadlines.
