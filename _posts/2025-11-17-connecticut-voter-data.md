- Your contact information
- Payment information or arrangement

### What's Included

When submitting your written request, specifically inquire about:
- Whether voter history is included with the voter registry file
- What historical coverage is provided
- File format and structure
- Any additional options or data available

## Cost

Connecticut charges **$300** for the statewide voter registry file on compact disc.

When requesting Connecticut voter data, users must comply with state laws regarding the use of voter registration records.
