Alabama provides access to voter registration data through an online portal with per-record pricing that makes it potentially one of the most expensive states for complete voter data. At $0.01 per voter record plus additional fees for voter history, a complete statewide list could cost approximately $37,000.

## Quick Summary

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Pricing Model** | $0.01 per voter record + voter history fees |
| **Estimated Statewide Cost** | ~$37,000 for complete list with history |
| **Voter List Access** | Online portal |
| **Voter History Access** | Appears to be included (confirmation needed) |
| **Delivery Method** | Online portal download |
| **Processing Time** | After portal request and payment |

## Voter List

Alabama provides voter registration data through Alabama Interactive's online portal system with per-voter pricing.

### How to Access

1. Visit the [Alabama Voter Registration Portal](https://www.alabamainteractive.org/sos/voter/introduction.action)
2. Create an account or log in
3. Select the voters you want to purchase
4. Calculate costs based on number of records
5. Complete payment through the portal
6. Download voter data

### What's Included

The voter registration data includes information for the voters you select through the portal system.

## Voter History

Based on available information, voter history appears to be available along with the voter list, but this should be confirmed.

### Recommendation

When using the Alabama portal, verify:
- Whether voter history is included with voter records
- Whether voter history has additional per-record charges
- What historical coverage is provided
- How voter history affects total cost

## Cost

Alabama uses a per-voter pricing model that can become very expensive for large datasets:

| Records | Base Cost (at $0.01/record) | Voter History | Estimated Total |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1,000 | $10 | + fees | ~$10+ |
| 10,000 | $100 | + fees | ~$100+ |
| 100,000 | $1,000 | + fees | ~$1,000+ |
| 1,000,000 | $10,000 | + fees | ~$10,000+ |
| **Statewide (~3.7M)** | **~$37,000** | **+ fees** | **~$37,000+** |

This makes Alabama one of the most expensive states for obtaining complete statewide voter data.

### Cost-Effective Strategies

For Alabama voter data:
- **Target specific counties** instead of statewide data
- **Select specific voter characteristics** if the portal allows filtering
- **Calculate exact costs** before committing to purchase
- **Consider whether you truly need complete statewide data**

## Restrictions and Permitted Uses

Alabama has specific rules regarding voter registration data access and use. Review the official guidance documents:
- [Public Inspection Rules for Voter Registration Information PDF](https://www.sos.alabama.gov/sites/default/files/voter-pdfs/Public-Inspection-Rules-for-Voter-Registration-Information.pdf)

When requesting Alabama voter data, users must comply with state laws regarding the use of voter registration records.

## Technical Notes

### Per-Voter Pricing Model

Alabama's per-voter pricing is unusual among states and creates significant cost challenges for researchers, campaigns, and organizations needing statewide data.

**Advantages:**
- Pay only for records you need
- Suitable for targeted county or precinct analysis
- Scalable for small projects

**Disadvantages:**
- Extremely expensive for statewide data
- Costs increase linearly with voter count
- No cap on maximum fees

### Portal System

The Alabama Interactive portal provides:
- Online account management
- Voter selection tools
- Cost calculation
- Secure payment
- Download capabilities

### Voter History Costs

The research notes indicate voter history may be available, potentially as part of the voter list. However:
- Voter history may have additional per-record charges
- Total costs could exceed the base $0.01 per voter
- Confirm pricing structure before large purchases

### Testing Status

This system has not been independently tested. Before making a large purchase:
1. Review the portal interface
2. Test with a small sample
3. Confirm exact pricing including voter history
4. Verify what's included in each record
5. Understand delivery formats and limitations

Alabama's per-voter pricing model makes it one of the most expensive states for comprehensive statewide voter data, with costs potentially reaching $37,000 or more. This pricing structure is best suited for targeted county or precinct-level analysis rather than statewide data needs. Carefully calculate costs and consider alternatives before committing to large purchases.
